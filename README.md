# AI Interview

Welcome to the AI Interview project! This application leverages AI technology to conduct interviews and answer general questions.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python 3**: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

## Running the Application

### On Unix-based Systems (Linux/macOS)

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Make the script executable (if not already):

   ```bash
   chmod +x run


### Notes:
- **`requirements.txt`**: Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory that lists all the dependencies for your project.
- **Batch File for Windows**: If you don't have a `run.bat` file, you can create one that includes the commands to run your application on Windows.

Feel free to adjust the README to fit your specific project details!



### Notes:
- **For Windows Users**: If you donâ€™t have a `run.bat` file, you can create one to run your script. If the script requires specific commands, include them in the batch file.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being committed to the repository.

Feel free to adjust the README to fit your specific project details!
